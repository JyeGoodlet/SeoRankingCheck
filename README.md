# Notes
Currently site app isn't working google.com. 
Not sure if its because it uses javascript now or if there is some kind of bot protection. The result from the browser and HAP are different.

For now i've replaced google with a fake google i generated. You can change the settings in AppSettings,json

### TODO's

 - Change the scraper to something that can parse javascipt. Eg selenium or firefox headless.
 - Add some more logging
 - Handle some errors better
